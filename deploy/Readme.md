# Understanding Scaling Behavior
KEDA’s Target Metric Value (blobCount):

The blobCount setting specifies the target metric value for scaling. KEDA scales based on how far above or below this target the actual metric is.
In the example above, if blobCount is set to "5", KEDA will scale 1 pod for every 5 files in the container.
Scaling Logic:

When there are 5 files: KEDA scales up 1 pod.
When there are 20 files: KEDA scales up 4 pods (because it’s 4 times the target value of 5).
As the number of files decreases: KEDA scales down pods accordingly. For example:
If there are 15 files left, it scales down to 3 pods.
If there are fewer than 5 files, it scales down to 1 pod.
When no files remain, it scales down to 0 pods.
Customizing Scaling Behavior: If you want more control, such as precise thresholds where different actions occur (e.g., scale 1 pod at 5 files, scale another pod at 20 files), you can tweak how you approach the scaling:

## Use Multiple ScaledObject Triggers: You could define multiple scaling triggers with different metrics, although this might complicate configuration.
Fine-Tune Pod Replica Settings: Adjust the minReplicaCount, maxReplicaCount, cooldownPeriod, and pollingInterval settings to achieve smoother scaling behavior.
Advanced Example with Custom Logic (Optional)
If you want precise control, such as scaling exactly at 5 and 20 files, a more advanced solution involves implementing a custom metric or logic outside of the default behavior. You could:

## Implement a custom metric (using Prometheus or an external metrics provider).
Use KEDA’s built-in Prometheus trigger to scale based on a more complex metric that you define.
However, for most cases, the linear scaling provided by setting the blobCount as shown above is sufficient and easier to maintain.

# Summary
Set the blobCount in the ScaledObject to 5 to achieve linear scaling (1 pod per 5 files).
KEDA will automatically scale up and down based on this target metric.
For more granular control, you can fine-tune KEDA’s parameters or explore custom metrics, but the default linear scaling should work well for your use case.
This configuration provides dynamic scaling that adjusts as the number of files in the blob container changes, matching the behavior you described.
